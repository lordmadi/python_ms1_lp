## Installing Python

In the previous concept, we mentioned that Python is an interpreted language, which means that the source code written in Python runs through a special interpreter that translates it to machine code. Python comes with its own interpreter in the installation package.

> If you have Python already installed or your administrator can install it for you, feel free to skip the next concept.

### Installing Python on Windows

First, head to the official Python downloads [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

Click on the link to download the latest version available.

![python windows install step 1](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/5QSKLcMQ1YRuAaeke6Mt3c/ea3c9fb4435c5428a085608e31c46312/python_windows_install_step_1.png)

Scroll down to a table labeled "Files". Choose the installer option you'd like from this table. The easiest one is to use the Windows installer option.

![python windows install step 2](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/5EofmP83chfI9DzfmntlSC/3f3aac2bcdc343fbb92ccef6340aee02/python_windows_install_step_2.png)

Once downloaded, click on the installer and choose "Install Now". You can also customize your installation if you'd like.

![python windows install step 3](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/1wzK7CUCR6tAWh4LmUc3a0/094b594e9621da11079eed617b64dabe/python_windows_install_step_3.png)

Wait for the installer to finish. If finished without any issues, you will get a message that says your installation was successful.

You can run the Python interactive shell by searching your computer with the keyword "Python". Click on it and you will be presented with a shell that looks like Windows Command Prompt to a great extent. In the example below, we ran a simple line of code that adds the numbers 5 and 10. 

![python windows install step 5](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/7ruqofb9gPfJjGc8l6qsZj/bbde1c46ba9f7da4c72dcb3c588c3bdf/python_windows_install_step_5.png)

> Python interactive shell executes arithmetic operations immediately once you press Enter after writing the expression.

### Installing Python on Mac OS

Most Mac OS machines come with Python pre-installed. However, they are usually old versions and on older Mac machines, these versions are even no longer maintained.

You can check the Python version installed on your Mac machine via the Terminal by running the following command:

```shell
python3 --version
```
If it shows you a version 3.x.x, then it means Python is already installed and you'd be fine with this version. 

If you'd like to update, head to the Python official downloads [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/), download the suitable version for your Mac machine (Intel Or ARM) 

If you receive an error that says "command not found", it means Python 3 is not installed on your machine. To install it, head to the downloads [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).

![mac install step 1](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/2tPLoYdcNhIkHCjcWtsF4r/a1f81b1932663132994cf48ca85a54ac/mac_install_step_1.png)

Once downloaded, click on the installer and choose "Continue" and follow the on-screen instructions.
![mac install step 2](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/188HQzshepRW8vzCipzFcI/41b5f8afba8b1550ca2e1218079c294c/mac_install_step_2.png)

Wait for the installer to finish. If finished without any issues, you will get a message that says your installation was successful.
![mac install step 4](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/3XsWffgjPzU3SqIdxtjbYB/a812797a7eb4818a935295d695018f28/mac_install_step_4.png)

You can access the Python interactive shell by typing `python3` inside the Terminal app. In the example below, we ran a simple line of code that adds the numbers 5 and 10. 

![mac install step 5](//images.ctfassets.net/nbtht4kjx2t0/3pvYrmoBaFHbT3ED2zKlVf/8660ff0037bcb8b8edb99e9014aee575/mac_install_step_5.png)

> The command to run Python version 3 on Mac is `python3` not `python`.

### Exercise

There are different ways to install Python rather than using the package installers. Can you find any alternatives online? Do some research and and see what you can find.
