## What Is A Programming Language?

In the previous concept, we learned that a computer program is a set of instructions thats controls how hardware operates and behaves. This raises the question of "how does the computer hardware receive and understand these instructions?". This is where programming languages come into play.

A programming language is a language that a computer understands. We use a programming language to communicate the instructions we —— humans —— want the computer to perform. 

You can think of a programming language as a native spoken language that a human being can speak and understand but in a much more strict environment. In spoken languages, one might express a certain feeling or ask a specific question using different words, accents and dialects. Take for example this basic conversation between two friends.

Friend 1: Hello, how are you doing today?
Friend 2: Hi! I am doing great, and you?
Friend 3: All good!

As you might observe, Friend 1 could have said "How is everything?" and it would've essentially had the exact same meaning. Human brains are superior in processing different sentences and understanding what they mean but even then, miscommunication is commonplace.

However, for computers, it's a different story. Modern computers that exist in almost every household understand and execute instructions only if such instructions are written in a precise form and have precise meanings. In programming, this precise form is referred to as the "Syntax" and the precise meaning is referred to as the "semantics".

## High-Level Versus Low-Level Programming Languages

Some terms you might encounter when learning programming are "High-Level" and "Low-Level" programming languages. 

High-level programming languages are easier to understand and read as a human since they abstract a lot of complex hardware details. They also allow for faster development across various platforms. Some examples of popular high-level programming languages are Python (which we'll be studying in this learning path), JavaScript and Java.

> JavaScript and Java are very different languages. There is a popular quote among programmers that reads "Java is to JavaScript as Car is to Carpet".

On the other hand, low-level programming languages are closer to the hardware. They are harder to read and have a higher learning curve than high-level ones. However, they are much more efficient in terms of speed and resource usage since they usually provide the programmer with direct control to the hardware. Some examples of low-level programming languages are assembly languages, such as x86 and ARM, and machine code.

> Note that when we speak about high-level and low-level programming languages, we aren't exactly specifying two categories. Instead, you can think of it as a range from high to low and programming languages are scattered across that range. For instance, a language like C++ is on a lower level when compared to Python but on a higher level when compared to Assembly.
