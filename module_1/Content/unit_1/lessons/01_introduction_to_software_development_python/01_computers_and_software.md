Computers have come a long way. When the early models of computers were first developed, they were essentially regarded as giant calculators with the sole purpose of crunching numbers and doing mathematical operations. To a great extent, this remains to be an important application in modern computers. In today's world, computers do a lot of things. Perhaps you use your computer to play video games, work on college assignments or organize your tasks.

In addition to that, computers are also used in vital applications that make our lives significantly easier such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, and online shopping.

So, what is a modern computer? One formal definition is: “a computer is a machine that stores, manipulates and processes data under the control of a changeable program”.

This definition leads us to another question, which is: “what is a program?”

## Computer Hardware Versus Software

If we abstract away the fairly complex pieces and parts forming a computer, we can think of a computer as a machine where hardware and software work in harmony to produce something useful. 

Computer hardware refers to the physical components or parts of a computer system that can be held, touched and seen. It includes all the tangible parts necessary for a computer to function, such as the central processing unit (CPU), graphical processing unit (GPU), random access memory (RAM), motherboard (MB), long-term storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), input devices (keyboard, mouse), and output devices (monitor, printer).

On the other hand, computer software refers to the intangible parts that complement hardware. Software is essentially the programs run on a computer. A program is a detailed step-by-step set of instructions telling the computer hardware exactly what to do. In other words, computer software rules how hardware operates and behaves.

Computer programs exist in many formats, such as websites that you can access via a web browser (Amazon and Google), mobile applications that run on your smartphone (Instagram and Line) and Desktop applications that run on your computer (MS Office and Skype).
