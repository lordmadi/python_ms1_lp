## How Does A Computer Understand Code?

In the previous concept, we mentioned that Python is a popular example of a high-level programming language. Python is relatively easy to read, write and, understand as it is developed in a way that makes its grammar  — or “syntax” — somehow close to writing plain English.

That being said, how does a computer understand code written in Python? You might think a computer might magically understand Python code but that’s not quite right. There is no magic involved in the process. Computers only understand instructions that are provided in binary notation, which is a sequence of zeros and ones.

So, in order for a computer to understand Python code and execute the program instructions, Python code must be translated to “machine code.” 

## Compilers Versus Interpreters

The process of translating/converting the code written by a human using a programming language to machine code happens through compilers and interpreters. Compilers and interpreters are special and complex programs themselves. But, what are the differences between both?

A compiler is a program that takes a program written in a programming language, converts it to an equivalent program in the machine language of some computer. 

An interpreter is a program that simulates a computer that understands a high-level programming language. It translates the given source code line by line as needed — much like a human interpreter translating a conversation between two parties on the fly. 

The key difference between a compiler and an interpreter is that a compiler translates the entire given source code in one shot. The translated code can then be executed as many times as needed, without the need to compile the source code again (given that no changes were made to the source code, of course).

On the other hand, an interpreter will need to translate the source code every time the program runs. 

That being said, compiled programs tend to be faster and more efficient than interpreted ones. However, interpreted programs still have the advantage of being more flexible and portable, as interpreters are usually cross platform and don’t require specific hardware.

## Exercise

Search the internet for some languages that use compilers versus others that use interpreters. There are some popular languages in both categories. Can you compare the advantages and disadvantages of each language? Can you find situations where one language is bette than the other?

In the next concept, we’ll see how to install Python and set up our development environment.
