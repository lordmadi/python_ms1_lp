## Data in Computer Programs

Any information that is stored and manipulated by computer programs is referred to as data. Data has a lot of different types. We'll begin by exploring some basic data types in Python.

There are a lot of data types in Python. Generally, we can categorize the majority of these data types into 8 categories:

- String
- Numeric
- Boolean
- Sequence
- Set
- Dictionary
- Binary
- None

In this lesson, we will be exploring **String** and **Numeric**  data types as they are the most basic and are very commonly used. As we advance towards more complex topics, we'll cover the remaining data types.

Let's begin by understanding what the **String** data type is all about.

## Strings in Python

Nowadays, texting and consuming content on the internet is an essential part of the day of even the most average users. All the texts you send and receive, all the articles and news you read and all the comments, tweets, and posts you write and read are essentially treated as **strings** in a computer program.

A string is a sequence of characters, numbers and or symbols that is ought to make sense for readers when read or given in a certain context. For instance:

- Your full name in your bank account details (eg: John Doe Smith)
- Your email address with the `@` symbol separating between your username and the email provider domain (eg: john_doe_smith@gmail.com)
- Your PS5 online gaming handle (eg: "R2D2" or "DarthVader2187")

To create a string in Python, you need to enclose the sequence of characters in double quotes or single quotes but not a mix of both. For instance: 

**Valid strings**
```python
user_name = "John Smith"
order_status = 'Completed'
```

**Invalid strings**

```python
book_title = "You do not know JavaScript'
```

## Exercise
Observe the following values and specify the data type for each one of them and why you think they belong to that type.

- `"Automaton"`
- `'Peppa Pig'`
- `"3.14"`
- `-5.5`
- `7`
- `10031901`
- `0`

In the next concept, we'll explore numeric data types in Python.
