## Numbers in Python

Not all numbers are created equal. Numeric representations in computer programs differ from one application to another. For instance, your bank account balance is usually represented in floats —— which are numbers with decimals. On the other hand, your employee ID is most likely an integer —— a whole number with no decimals.

## Integers

Creating an integer —— whether positive or negative —— is really easy. You just type the number without any enclosing quotes, as follows:

```python
employee_id = 2187
employee_age = 25
temperature = -4
```

## Floats

Similarly, creating a float doesn't require enclosing quotes. You just type the number in its decimal representation, as follows:

```python
athlete_weight = 65.8
account_balance = 15130.87
negative_correlation = -1.7
```

## Exercise

Given a variable `celsius = 25.0`:
Create a variable `fahrenheit` that stores the conversion of the value stored in `celsius ` to `fahrenheit`. 

> Hint: You can look up the mathematical formula on the internet.
